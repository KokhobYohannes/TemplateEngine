**Template Engines: Employee Summary**

**Description:**
A CLI node.js app created to generate an employee summary for a manager, an engineer and an intern. Once the user runs node.js, they will be prompted to enter the name, email, employee id and office number for the manager. Then they will be prompted to select the next role to complete from a list for either an engineer, intern or to exit. Once the user has finished entering the employee data, a new html page will be generated where the user can view the summary/output.


**Usage:**
1) Run npm i
2) Run node.js
